# Device Enumerator for OpenCV 

This project contains a **C++** class that allows the enumeration of devices using DirectShow in Windows, in order to select and obtain the ID that needs to be used with OpenCV when creating, for example, a VideoCapture object to grab frames from a camera. I decided to put this up as "How to get the ID of a device to use inside OpenCV?" is a question that pops up continuously. The maintainers of OpenCV don't include this functionality in the library because it is **very** operating system dependant.

## Contents

The project contains the class itself (DeviceEnumerator.h and DeviceEnumerator.cpp) and also an example of how to use the class (OpenCVDeviceEnumerator.cpp)
